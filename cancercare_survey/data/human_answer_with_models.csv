9,I was diagnosed with CLL in 2003 and have no symptoms. My white cell count is about 120 and my platelets are at 290. My oncologist wants me to take Rituxan to get the counts down. I do not have an enlarged spleen and have not gotten sick. I have been told by my primary doctor that you should treat the symptoms not the counts. How do I get my oncologist to understand this?,"CLL or, chronic lymphocytic leukemia is the most common adult leukemia. The average age of diagnosis is 65 to 67 years of age, although it is diagnosed in younger adults as well. It is one of four main types of leukemias. Because it is a chronic disease people can go years without treatment, so it is important to monitor the disease for any changes. 

It appears you are struggling with different medical opinions. Your doctor suggests focusing on symptoms while your oncologist believes that the elevated counts indicate it is time for treatment. This is a common struggle for patients – what to do when you receive differing medical opinions? There is often uncertainty in which is the best option, and ultimately the decision rests with the patient. 

Doctors can suggest, strongly sometimes, treatment options that patients do not feel comfortable with. When that happens it is helpful to open up a dialogue with your doctor where you can explore the rationale behind his/her thinking and you can express your concerns. An open and honest relationship with your health care team (often referred to as a partnership) is important. For many patients this additional knowledge helps them make an informed decision. For oncologists and other members of the health care team, it lets them know about what is important to the patient and how they want to approach his/her disease.

It's natural to question the need for medication when your body seems to be managing the condition well. 
 

 It's important to have open and honest communication with both your oncologist and primary doctor. Here's how you can approach the conversation:
 1. * **Express your concerns clearly:** Explain to your oncologist that you understand the rationale behind Rituxan but are hesitant to start treatment without experiencing any symptoms. 


 2. * **Ask about the rationale for treatment:** Understand why your oncologist recommends Rituxan at this stage. What are the potential benefits and risks of starting now versus waiting? What are the potential consequences of delaying treatment?


 3. * **Discuss your primary doctor's perspective:** Share your primary doctor's ""treat the symptoms, not the counts"" approach with your oncologist. This can open up a dialogue about different treatment philosophies.


 4. * **Inquire about watchful waiting:** Ask if watchful waiting, which involves close monitoring without immediate treatment, is a viable option for you. 


 5. * **Get a second opinion:** If you're still unsure after speaking with your oncologist, consider getting a second opinion from another hematologist-oncologist specializing in CLL. 
 

 Remember, the decision to start treatment is ultimately yours. Gather all the information, weigh the risks and benefits, and make an informed choice that aligns with your values and preferences. 
 

 **Please schedule an appointment with your oncologist to discuss your concerns and treatment options in detail.**","Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. The disease often progresses slowly, and many patients, like yourself, may not exhibit symptoms for years. The management of CLL, particularly in asymptomatic patients, can vary significantly based on various factors including patient age, overall health, specific genetic markers, and changes in blood counts over time.
 

Here are some steps you can take to address your concerns with your oncologist and to discuss the potential treatment plan:
 1. **Prepare for the Discussion**: Before your appointment, gather all your medical records related to CLL, including your latest blood tests, any previous treatments, and notes on your current health status and how you’ve been feeling. This will help provide a comprehensive picture to discuss with your oncologist.
 

 2. **Express Your Concerns Clearly**: Start by clearly expressing your concerns about starting treatment with Rituxan given your lack of symptoms. Mention the advice from your primary doctor about treating symptoms rather than counts, and ask for clarification on why treatment is being recommended now.
 

 3. **Ask for Clarification and Rationale**: Request a detailed explanation of why your oncologist believes treatment is necessary at this stage. This should include:
  - The potential risks of waiting to treat until symptoms develop.
  - The benefits of starting treatment now despite the absence of symptoms.
  - Any recent studies or guidelines that support treating CLL patients with elevated white cell counts but no symptoms.
 

 4. **Discuss Treatment Goals and Outcomes**: Understand what the goals of the proposed treatment are. Is the aim to reduce the white cell count, prevent future complications, or something else? Knowing what the expected outcomes are can help you make a more informed decision.
 

 5. **Consider a Second Opinion**: If after discussing with your oncologist, you still feel uncertain, it may be beneficial to seek a second opinion from another hematologist or oncologist who specializes in CLL. This can provide additional perspectives on your treatment options.
 

 6. **Discuss Monitoring and Follow-up**: If you and your oncologist decide to wait on treatment, make sure you have a clear follow-up plan to monitor your health and blood counts regularly. This can help catch any changes early and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.
 

 7. **Patient Preference and Quality of Life**: Emphasize your preferences, lifestyle, and quality of life considerations. Treatment decisions, especially in diseases like CLL where the progression can be slow, should align with your personal values and life goals.
 

 8. **Document Your Discussion**: Keep notes from your discussions with healthcare providers. This can help you track the evolution of your condition and the thought process behind your treatment decisions over time.
 

 It's important to have open and honest communication with your oncologist. They should be able to provide you with information that is not only based on clinical evidence but also considers your personal circumstances and preferences. Remember, the final decision on whether to start treatment should be made collaboratively, taking into account the best available medical advice and your own comfort and understanding of the risks and benefits.","CLL (Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. It is characterized by an overproduction of abnormal white blood cells, which can lead to anemia, infections, and other complications.

Rituxan (rituximab) is a medication that is commonly used to treat CLL. It works by targeting and killing the abnormal white blood cells that are causing the disease.

However, the decision to start treatment for CLL is complex and depends on several factors, including the severity of the disease, the presence of symptoms, and the patient's overall health.

In your case, since you have no symptoms and your platelet count is normal, your primary doctor's approach of ""treating the symptoms, not the counts"" may be a reasonable one. This approach is often referred to as ""watchful waiting"" or ""active surveillance.""


1. To discuss this approach with your oncologist, you may want to ask questions such as:
* What are the benefits and risks of starting Rituxan treatment at this time?
* How will treatment affect my quality of life?
* Are there any other treatment options available?
* What are the criteria for starting treatment, and how will we monitor my condition to determine when treatment is necessary?


2. You may also want to consider seeking a second opinion from another oncologist or a specialist in CLL to get a different perspective on your treatment options.


Ultimately, the decision to start treatment is a personal one that should be made in consultation with your healthcare team."
19," After two surgical operations on my rectum and colon and receiving chemotherapy, I have numbness and reduced sensitivity in my fingers and feet. My doctors suggested Gabapentin, but it gave me problems with my sense of balance. Is there anything else I can do to lessen these symptoms?","The numbness and reduced sensitivity in your fingers and feet is called peripheral neuropathy, which is nerve damage that often results from certain chemotherapy treatments (e.g., oxaliplatin). It is sometimes referred to as the “glove and stocking sensation,” as it feels similar to wearing gloves or thick stockings on your hands or feet. 

Certain medications can reduce the pain and annoying physical sensations that accompany neuropathy while the nerves repair themselves. Gabapentin relieves the pain of neuropathy by changing the way your body senses pain. It is meant to control your condition but will not cure it. Fortunately, there are several other types of medications for neuropathy, including anticonvulsants, antidepressants, local anesthetics, and opioids, that can be taken individually or in combination. Work with your doctor to find the right approach for you. Keep in mind that it can take one to two years or more for symptoms to go away completely. 

Here are some tips that may help you manage and cope with the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy: 

Avoid drinking alcohol, which can damage nerves.

Wear sneakers or shoes with “rocker bottoms” that allow the feet to roll while walking, provide better traction and can relieve some of the pressure on the soles.

Remove throw rugs from your home to reduce the chance of slipping and falling.

Rather than stand, sit down while doing activities such as drying your hair, applying makeup or preparing food.

Use hand tools, kitchen utensils, and even toothbrushes and pens with wider grips, to make them easier to hold.

If you have diabetes, manage your blood sugar level very carefully, as high levels can have a negative impact on nerves.

Join a support group to learn how others lived with, and overcome, the challenges of neuropathy.Consult a psychiatrist, physical therapist, or occupational therapist who can provide guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.

CancerCare has several resources to help you learn more about living with neuropathy. Listen to our Connect Education Workshop podcast, Understanding Peripheral Neuropathy.

It's great that you're proactive about your health! 
 

 It's important to work directly with your doctor to find the best treatment plan for you. Here's why:
 1. * **Underlying Causes:** Peripheral neuropathy can have various causes, and your doctor needs to determine the specific reason for your symptoms to recommend the most effective treatment. 


 2. * **Medication Interactions:** Suggesting alternative medications or treatments without a doctor's guidance can be dangerous due to potential interactions with your current medications or health conditions.


 3. * **Individualized Care:** Treatment plans for neuropathy are tailored to each individual, considering their medical history, overall health, and potential side effects.
 

 4. **Here's what I can suggest to help you have a productive conversation with your doctor:**
 * **Be prepared to discuss:**
  * The specific symptoms you're experiencing (e.g., numbness, tingling, pain)
  * When the symptoms started and how they've progressed
  * Any other medications or supplements you're taking
  * Your experience with Gabapentin and its side effects
 * **Ask your doctor about:**
  * Other medications that might be helpful for your neuropathy
  * Non-medication options like physical therapy, acupuncture, or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)
  * Lifestyle changes that could help manage your symptoms, such as regular exercise, a healthy diet, and avoiding alcohol and smoking
 

 Remember, open communication with your doctor is crucial for finding the best way to manage your neuropathy and improve your quality of life.","I'm sorry to hear about the challenges you're facing following your treatments. The symptoms you're describing, such as numbness and reduced sensitivity in your fingers and feet, sound like peripheral neuropathy, which is a common side effect of some chemotherapy drugs. It's important to manage these symptoms effectively, as they can significantly impact your quality of life.
 

Since Gabapentin did not work well for you due to its side effects, there are several other approaches and treatments you might consider discussing with your healthcare provider:
 1. **Alternative Medications**: There are other medications that can be used to manage neuropathy pain and symptoms. These include:
  - **Pregabalin (Lyrica)**: Similar to Gabapentin but might have a different side effect profile that could be better tolerated.
  - **Duloxetine (Cymbalta)**: Often used for diabetic neuropathy and fibromyalgia, and might be effective for chemotherapy-induced neuropathy.
  - **Amitriptyline or Nortriptyline**: These are tricyclic antidepressants that can help with nerve pain.
 

 2. **Topical Treatments**: Some topical treatments like capsaicin cream or lidocaine patches can provide local relief from neuropathy symptoms without the systemic side effects of oral medications.
 

 3. **Physical Therapy**: Working with a physical therapist can help you manage symptoms and improve your balance and muscle strength, potentially reducing the risk of falls and improving your functional mobility.
 

 4. **Acupuncture**: Some patients find relief from neuropathy symptoms through acupuncture. Clinical studies have shown mixed results, but it might be worth trying if you're interested in non-pharmacological options.
 

 5. **Vitamin Supplements**: Certain vitamins, such as B vitamins (especially B12), vitamin E, and alpha-lipoic acid, have been studied for their potential to help with nerve repair and symptom relief in neuropathy. It's important to discuss these with your doctor, especially to ensure they do not interfere with your ongoing treatments.
 

 6. **Lifestyle Modifications**: Regular exercise can help improve overall circulation and nerve health. Additionally, maintaining a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can support nerve health.
 

 7. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: CBT and other psychological therapies can help you cope with the discomfort and stress caused by neuropathy.
 

 It's crucial to continue working closely with your healthcare team to monitor your symptoms and adjust treatments as necessary. Each person's response to treatment can vary significantly, so finding the right combination of therapies tailored to your specific situation is important.
 

 Lastly, ensure that any new treatment or modification to your regimen is discussed and approved by your healthcare provider to avoid any adverse interactions or side effects.","Gabapentin is often prescribed for nerve pain and numbness, but it can indeed cause balance issues in some individuals.

Here are some alternative options you can discuss with your doctor:
1.  **Other medications**: There are other medications that can help with nerve pain and numbness, such as pregabalin (Lyrica), duloxetine (Cymbalta), or amitriptyline (Elavil). Your doctor can help you determine if any of these might be a good fit for you.

2.  **Physical therapy**: A physical therapist can help you with exercises to improve your balance and reduce numbness in your fingers and feet. They can also provide you with techniques to manage pain and improve your overall mobility.

3.  **Lifestyle changes**: Making some lifestyle changes can also help alleviate your symptoms. This includes:
    *   **Exercise regularly**: Regular exercise can help improve circulation, reduce pain, and improve overall mobility.
    *   **Maintain a healthy diet**: Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help support nerve health.
    *   **Get enough sleep**: Getting adequate sleep is essential for nerve health and overall well-being.
    *   **Manage stress**: Stress can exacerbate nerve pain and numbness. Engage in stress-reducing activities like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.

4.  **Alternative therapies**: Some alternative therapies, such as acupuncture, massage, or reflexology, may also help alleviate numbness and pain in your fingers and feet. However, consult with your doctor before trying any new therapies.

5.  **Vitamin supplements**: Certain vitamin deficiencies, such as vitamin B12 deficiency, can cause nerve pain and numbness. Your doctor may recommend vitamin supplements to help alleviate your symptoms."
18," I was recently diagnosed with colon cancer and will have surgery and then a colostomy. I'm grateful that surgery is an option, but I'm struggling with the idea of having a colostomy. Any advice?","Adjusting to a cancer diagnosis can be challenging enough; adjusting to physical challenges that might come with it can seem overwhelming. It’s completely normal to wonder how you will manage. Seeking out information and support will help you to understand what to expect and how to best cope with change. 

If cancer is detected in your colon or rectum, a colostomy is performed. A colostomy surgically creates a “stoma” or small opening in the lower abdomen through which stool can exit the body. Usually, the waste is captured in a small bag that is worn on the body and can be easily disposed of. While this procedure will have an obvious impact on your daily routines, keep in mind that you will still be able to do all the things you enjoy, including physical activities such as sports or gardening, and continue to live a full life with a colostomy. 

To understand the impact a colostomy will have on you, talk with your doctors prior to your surgery about what you should expect before and after the procedure. It is also helpful to know the types of assistance and support available to you after your surgery. Ask to see an enterostomal therapy (ET) nurse, who specializes in ostomy care and rehabilitation. 

Speaking with an oncology social worker or joining a support group where you can discuss your concerns and learn how others have coped and adjusted can be very useful. Connecting with others who have “been there” can be incredibly supportive and informative. 

You can find additional information and support through The United Ostomy Association of America, which provides guidebooks, reference cards and brochures, as well as a message board where patients and caregivers can exchange information and answer questions. You can also find a local or virtual support group. 

Remember that with any change comes loss.

34,I have stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer and now am receiving Tarceva. I'm trying to prepare for the future by exploring hospice and want support for my husband. Do you know what kind of pain I might expect?,"There is no easy means of determining how late-stage lung cancer may progress. At times the process can be relatively benign and pain free; at other times, it may cause the person with cancer to deal with discomfort and pain. You have already identified one of the most appropriate resources for managing your situation - hospice care. 

Hospice provides some of the best palliative care available and focuses on the patient’s physical, emotional and spiritual comfort. We encourage patients and family members dealing with late-stage cancer to contact local hospices as soon as possible. This gives patients and their loved ones the opportunity to develop a relationship with staff and ask questions (such as how pain and symptoms can be managed) and to determine what services could be helpful. Connecting with hospice often times results in peace of mind for both patient and family members, as needs can be assesed, questions answered, and important next steps identified.

41," I underwent a modified radical neck dissection. I lost feeling on the left side of my neck, head, tongue and shoulder. I have no sense of taste and have difficulty swallowing. Will the feeling and sense of taste return?","There are a number of changes after treatment similar to what you’ve described, some of which can be permanent. Rehabilitation, however, can ease the side effects of treatment, and there are ways to cope with these effects over the long term. 

Given the complexities of treating head and neck cancer, a team approach which utilizes a variety of different specialists is essential to minimizing the complications and maximizing the chances for recovery. In addition to the treating physicians—an oral or ear, nose and throat surgeon, a medical and/or radiation oncologist, a plastic surgeon, prosthodontist, and a dentist among them—a number of other health care professionals can assist with your recovery. These other team members include dietitians, social workers, nurses, physical therapists, and speech-language therapists. 

Check with your surgeon regarding the loss of feeling on the side of neck. While nerves may have been cut in the area during the node dissection, you should not rule out at least some sensation returning over time. Have your taste and swallowing problems evaluated using tests such as the modified barium swallow (a kind of x-ray) or fiberoptic endoscopy. A speech-language pathologist can provide advice and guide you with therapeutic exercises to improve swallowing ability. There are also medications (both prescription and over the counter) that can help with saliva problems and dietary changes (such as avoiding foods that are made up of small particles) to ensure you continue to obtain sufficient nutrition. 

Consider joining a peer support group at your local medical center or through organizations such as Support for People with Oral and Head and Neck Cancer (SPOHNC) or CancerCare.","There are a number of changes after treatment similar to what you’ve described, some of which can be permanent.

It is important to discuss your concerns and recovery with your doctor. 
 

 That being said, here's some general information about the procedure you mentioned:
 

 A modified radical neck dissection is a major surgery that can lead to various side effects, including the ones you described. The extent and duration of these side effects depend on several factors, including the extent of the surgery, individual healing, and other medical conditions.
 

 1. * **Nerve Damage:** Loss of feeling (numbness) and difficulty swallowing are often due to damage to nerves in the neck during surgery. Some nerves may regenerate over time, leading to partial or complete recovery. However, this process can take months or even years, and in some cases, the damage may be permanent.


 2. * **Taste Loss:** Taste loss can be a side effect of nerve damage or damage to the salivary glands during surgery. Like nerve regeneration, taste recovery varies greatly from person to person. 


 3. * **Rehabilitation:** Your doctor may recommend rehabilitation therapies, such as speech therapy for swallowing difficulties and physical therapy for neck and shoulder mobility.
 

 4. **It is crucial to have open and honest conversations with your doctor about your recovery.** They can assess your specific situation, provide a realistic timeline for potential recovery, and recommend appropriate therapies or interventions. 
 

 Remember, everyone heals differently, and your doctor is your best resource for information and guidance throughout your recovery process.","I'm sorry to hear about your difficulties following a modified radical neck dissection. This type of surgery can indeed result in various complications, including those you are experiencing. The outcomes regarding nerve function recovery can vary based on several factors, including the extent of the surgery and the specific nerves affected.
 

 1. **Nerve Damage**: During a modified radical neck dissection, certain nerves may be intentionally or unintentionally affected. For example, the accessory nerve (which affects shoulder movement), the hypoglossal nerve (which affects tongue movement), and the lingual nerve (which affects taste) can be impacted. The extent of nerve damage (whether the nerves were stretched, bruised, or cut) will significantly influence the potential for recovery.
 

 2. **Recovery Time**: Nerve recovery can be a slow process and may take several months to years. In some cases, if the nerve has been severed, the recovery might be partial or not occur at all. If the nerve is bruised or stretched, there is a better chance of recovery, although it may still take a considerable amount of time.
 

 3. **Symptom Management**: It's important to manage symptoms and adapt to changes while recovery is ongoing. Speech and swallowing therapy can help improve your ability to swallow and speak, and physical therapy might assist with shoulder and neck mobility. 
 

 4. **Follow-up Care**: Regular follow-up with your healthcare provider is crucial. They can assess the progress of nerve recovery, adjust treatments as necessary, and provide support for any ongoing issues. They might also recommend imaging studies or tests to evaluate the status of the nerves and surrounding tissues.
 

 5. **Sensory Changes**: The return of taste and sensation can be unpredictable. The lingual nerve, which is crucial for taste sensations to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, and other sensory nerves in the neck and face area, if damaged, might recover over time, but there is no guarantee to what extent this will happen.
 

 6. **Emotional and Psychological Support**: Dealing with changes in body function and sensation can be challenging emotionally and psychologically. Support from counseling or support groups can be beneficial in coping with these changes.
 

 It's important to maintain open communication with your surgical team and primary care provider. They can provide you with the most accurate information tailored to your specific situation and guide you through the recovery process.","I'm so sorry to hear that you're experiencing these challenges after your surgery. A modified radical neck dissection can indeed cause nerve damage, leading to numbness, loss of sensation, and difficulties with swallowing and taste.

The likelihood of regaining feeling and sense of taste depends on several factors, including:
1. **Nerve damage extent**: The degree of nerve damage during surgery can impact the potential for recovery. If the nerves were severely damaged or cut, the chances of full recovery might be lower.

2. **Type of nerves affected**: The specific nerves involved can influence the outcome. For example, the lingual nerve (responsible for taste and sensation on the tongue) and the hypoglossal nerve (involved in swallowing) have a relatively good prognosis for recovery.

3. **Time since surgery**: The sooner you start experiencing some return of sensation or function, the better the chances of further improvement. Generally, nerve regeneration and recovery can occur within 6-12 months after surgery, but it can take up to 2 years or more for some individuals.

4. **Individual variability**: People's bodies heal and recover at different rates. Factors like overall health, age, and the presence of any underlying medical conditions can influence the recovery process.

In general, some patients may experience:
* **Partial recovery**: You might regain some sensation, taste, or swallowing function, but not fully.
* **Complete recovery**: In some cases, patients may regain full sensation, taste, and swallowing function.
* **Permanent damage**: Unfortunately, some nerve damage can be permanent, and sensation, taste, or swallowing function may not return.

To maximize your chances of recovery, consider the following:
1. **Follow your doctor's instructions**: Adhere to your post-operative care plan, including any recommended exercises, medications, or follow-up appointments.

2. **Physical therapy**: Engage in regular physical therapy sessions to help improve swallowing function and address any related issues.

3. **Sensory re-education**: Your healthcare team may recommend exercises to help your brain adapt to the changes in sensation and taste.

4. **Nutritional support**: Ensure you're getting adequate nutrition, as a healthy diet can support the healing process.

5. **Stay positive and patient**: Recovery from nerve damage can be a slow and frustrating process. Stay positive, and celebrate small improvements along the way.

It's essential to maintain open communication with your healthcare team, including your surgeon, primary care physician, and any specialists involved in your care. They can provide personalized guidance, monitor your progress, and address any concerns or questions you may have.

Keep in mind that every individual's recovery is unique, and it's difficult to predict the extent of your recovery. However, with time, patience, and proper care, you may experience some improvement in sensation, taste, and swallowing function."

 **It is crucial that you discuss your questions and concerns with your oncologist.** They are the best source of information about your specific type and stage of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, your overall health, and how your body might react to stopping treatment. 
 

 Here's why it's so important to talk to your doctor:
 1. * **Every case is unique:** The progression of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma varies greatly from person to person. Your doctor understands your individual medical history and can give you a more personalized estimate of what to expect.


 2. * **Pain management:** Your doctor can discuss potential symptoms, including pain, and help you create a plan to manage them effectively. There are many options available to address pain and discomfort.


 3. * **Palliative care:** Your doctor can connect you with palliative care specialists who focus on providing comfort and improving quality of life for people with serious illnesses. 


 4. * **Emotional support:** Making the decision to stop treatment is deeply personal. Your doctor can provide emotional support and connect you with resources to help you cope with this challenging time.
 

 Please remember that you are not alone. Reach out to your healthcare team, loved ones, and support groups for guidance and understanding.","I'm sorry to hear about your situation. Deciding to stop treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a significant decision that comes with many considerations, including how it will affect your quality of life and what symptoms you might experience as the disease progresses.
 

 As the disease progresses without treatment, the symptoms and their severity can vary significantly from person to person, depending on the type of lymphoma, its location, the stage of the disease, and your overall health. Common symptoms of advanced non-Hodgkin's lymphoma may include:
 1. **Increased Swelling of Lymph Nodes:** You might notice that the lymph nodes, typically in the neck, armpits, or groin, become more swollen and possibly painful.
 2. **Fatigue:** This is a very common symptom and can become more pronounced.
 3. **Fever, Night Sweats, and Chills:** These symptoms can occur intermittently.
 4. **Weight Loss and Decreased Appetite:** As the body's energy is diverted towards fighting the lymphoma, you might experience weight loss and a reduced desire to eat.
 5. **Pain:** As lymphoma progresses, it can cause pain due to the enlargement of lymph nodes or when the disease affects other organs and bones. The level of pain can vary, and there are effective ways to manage it through medications and other palliative care techniques.
 6. **Infections:** The immune system can be compromised, making you more susceptible to infections.
 7. **Breathing Difficulties and Cough:** If lymphoma affects the chest area or causes significant lymph node swelling, it might lead to breathing issues or a persistent cough.
 

 Regarding pain and symptom management, it is crucial to have a good palliative care team. Palliative care focuses on providing relief from the symptoms and stress of a serious illness. The goal is to improve quality of life for both the patient and the family. This care can be provided alongside curative treatment or as the main focus when curative treatment is no longer an option.
 

 Palliative treatments might include:
 - **Pain Management:** Using medications such as opioids and non-opioid pain relievers to manage pain effectively.
 - **Nutritional Support:** Helping you maintain your strength and nutritional status as much as possible.
 - **Emotional and Psychological Support:** Providing resources and therapy to help you and your family cope with the emotional aspects of your illness.
 

 It's important to have open and honest discussions with your healthcare provider about your wishes, symptoms, and any concerns you might have. They can provide you with detailed information tailored to your specific situation and help you manage the symptoms effectively.
 

 If you haven't already, consider discussing your decision and its implications with a healthcare professional who understands your medical history. They can offer more personalized guidance and support.","I'm so sorry to hear about your decision to stop treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

1. **Fatigue**: Feeling weak, tired, and lacking energy.

2. **Weight loss**: Losing weight due to a decrease in appetite, nausea, or difficulty eating.

7. **Bleeding or bruising**: Easy bleeding or bruising due to low blood platelet counts.

8. **Digestive issues**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.

9. **Skin problems**: Skin lesions, itching, or rashes.

Pain management is a crucial aspect of palliative care. Your healthcare team will work with you to develop a pain management plan to minimize your discomfort. This may include:
1. **Pain medications**: Opioids, non-opioids, or combination therapies to control pain.
2. **Radiation therapy**: Targeted radiation to relieve pain and reduce tumor size.
3. **Nerve blocks**: Injecting medication into nerves to block pain signals.
4. **Alternative therapies**: Acupuncture, massage, or other complementary therapies to help manage pain and symptoms.

1. **Symptom management**: Managing symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath.
2. **Emotional support**: Counseling, therapy, or support groups to address emotional and psychological needs.

4. **Practical support**: Assistance with daily activities, such as bathing, dressing, and managing medications.

It's crucial to have open and honest discussions with your healthcare team about your wishes, concerns, and expectations. They will work with you to develop a personalized care plan that addresses your physical, emotional, and spiritual needs.

66," I have received several different treatment recommendations from doctors, and I have to decide what type of treatment to have. This overwhelms me. How can I make the right choice?","It’s normal to feel scared about making such an important decision, and it is a decision you need to make in partnership with your healthcare team. Women today are offered many more choices than in the past, and are often asked to make the final decision about their care. You need to gather information about your different treatment options so that you feel confident discussing your concerns with your doctors. 

After talking with your doctors, keep in mind that you have obtained an expert medical opinion, and you need to understand your doctor’s perspective by asking why he or she has made that recommendation. It is important that you not compare yourself to other women in a similar situation. Even women who have the same diagnosis can have a different treatment plan—neither is right or wrong. Rather, it is individualized to you and your body. However, you can review with your doctor the information you learn from other women who have your type of cancer to better understand your own treatment plan. 

In making a decision about what treatment to choose, make sure you identify what is most important to you. For example, if you are concerned about chemotherapy, what are the reasons for your concern? What questions do you need answered? Often, people fear that if they choose one type of treatment over another, they will always worry that they did not choose correctly. Instead, ask yourself questions such as: “What am I being told, and why? What do I think is the best choice for me at this time?” The most important thing is that you make the decision that you are most comfortable with.

* What can we do to help stimulate my mother's appetite?
* Are there any medications or supplements that can help with appetite or nausea?
* How can we ensure my mother is getting enough nutrients during treatment?
* Are there any specific foods or food groups that my mother should focus on or avoid?

While I'm not a doctor, I can provide some general information that might help you understand potential causes and suggest steps you could take.
 

 Chemotherapy can cause a variety of side effects, including joint pain. This pain can sometimes persist for months or even years after treatment has ended. The reasons for this can vary and may include factors such as the specific drugs used, the dosage, and your body's response to the treatment. Some chemotherapy drugs are known to cause peripheral neuropathy or other types of nerve damage, which might also manifest as pain in the joints.
 

 Here are a few steps you might consider:
 1. **Consult Your Doctor**: It's important to discuss your knee pain with your healthcare provider. They can help determine if the pain is indeed linked to your previous chemotherapy or if it's caused by something else. This might involve a physical examination, and possibly imaging tests like an X-ray or MRI.
 

 2. **Pain Management**: Your doctor might recommend treatments for managing the pain. This could include medications, physical therapy, or alternative therapies such as acupuncture.
 

 3. **Exercise and Physical Therapy**: Sometimes, strengthening the muscles around the knee can help alleviate pain. A physical therapist can design a program tailored to your needs, which can help improve joint function and reduce pain.
 

 4. **Diet and Nutrition**: Eating a balanced diet rich in anti-inflammatory foods might help reduce joint pain. Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and vitamins can be beneficial.
 

 5. **Medication Review**: If you're currently on any medications, review these with your doctor. Some drugs can contribute to joint pain as a side effect.
 

 6. **Support Groups**: Sometimes, sharing your experiences with others who have gone through similar health issues can provide not only emotional support but also practical advice on managing side effects like joint pain.
 

 It's important to address this pain and not just hope it will go away on its own. Persistent pain can affect your quality of life, and finding the right approach to manage it is crucial. Always ensure that any treatment or advice is provided by a healthcare professional who knows your medical history.","Chemotherapy can cause long-term side effects, including joint pain, particularly in the knees. Several factors contribute to this phenomenon:
*   **Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy**: Certain chemotherapy agents can damage nerve endings, leading to chronic pain.
*   **Hormonal changes**: Chemotherapy can induce menopause or menopause-like symptoms, which can lead to joint pain.
*   **Inflammation**: Chemotherapy can cause inflammation in the body, which may contribute to joint pain.

The duration of knee pain after chemotherapy varies from person to person. In some cases, the pain may subside over time, while in others, it may persist. Factors that influence the duration of knee pain include:
*   **Type and dosage of chemotherapy**: Different chemotherapy agents and dosages can affect the severity and duration of joint pain.
*   **Individual tolerance**: People's bodies respond differently to chemotherapy, which can impact the duration of side effects.
*   **Lifestyle factors**: Maintaining a healthy weight, engaging in regular exercise, and managing stress can help alleviate joint pain.

While it's difficult to predict exactly when the knee pain will end, there are ways to manage and reduce the discomfort:
*   **Pain management medications**: Over-the-counter or prescription medications can help alleviate pain and inflammation.

*   **Physical therapy**: Gentle exercises and stretches can improve joint mobility and reduce pain.

*   **Alternative therapies**: Acupuncture, massage, or yoga may help manage pain and improve overall well-being.

*   **Lifestyle modifications**: Maintaining a healthy weight, staying active, and getting enough rest can help reduce joint pain.

 2. **Consult Healthcare Providers**: Before adding protein powder or making any significant dietary changes, it's important to consult with your father’s healthcare team. They can provide personalized advice based on his specific medical condition, treatment plan, and nutritional needs.
 

 3. **Consider Digestibility**: Adding extra protein powder might increase the protein content, but it could also make the drink thicker or harder to digest, which might not be helpful if your father is already experiencing nausea and vomiting.
 

 **Other Ways to Increase Caloric Intake:**
 1. **Frequent, Small Meals**: Instead of three large meals, small frequent meals can be less daunting and might be easier to manage.
 

 2. **High-Calorie, Nutrient-Dense Foods**: When he feels able to eat, offer foods that are high in calories and nutrients. Examples include avocados, nut butters, and smoothies made with fruits, yogurt, or milk.
 

 3. **Hydration**: Staying hydrated is crucial. If plain water is unappealing, try flavored water, broth, or small amounts of juice.
 

 4. **Ginger and Peppermint**: These can sometimes help reduce nausea. Ginger tea or peppermint tea might be soothing and can also provide some hydration.
 

 5. **Medication for Nausea**: If nausea and vomiting are significant issues, discuss with his doctor whether any adjustments to his anti-nausea medications are needed.
 

 6. **Nutritional Supplements**: In addition to Ensure, there are other types of nutritional supplements designed for various needs, including those that are easier on the stomach or designed for people undergoing medical treatments. His doctor or a dietitian might have specific recommendations.
 

 7. **Emotional Support**: Emotional well-being can also affect appetite. Providing support, creating a pleasant eating environment, and encouraging social interaction during meals can sometimes help.
 

 It's crucial to keep his medical team informed about all the strategies you are considering so they can help guide you through this challenging time effectively. They might also refer you to a dietitian who specializes in oncology nutrition for more tailored advice.","I'm so sorry to hear that your father is going through a tough time with chemotherapy. It's great that you're looking for ways to support him.

Mixing protein powder into Ensure drinks can be a good idea, but it's essential to consider a few things first:
1. **Consult with his healthcare team**: Before adding any supplements, including protein powder, consult with his oncologist, nurse, or a registered dietitian who is familiar with his case. They can help determine the best approach for his specific needs and ensure that it won't interact with his treatment.

2. **Choose a suitable protein powder**: Opt for a protein powder that is:
        * Unflavored or mildly flavored to avoid altering the taste of the Ensure.
        * Hypoallergenic (e.g., pea, rice, or egg protein) to minimize the risk of an allergic reaction.
        * Low in added sugars, artificial sweeteners, and other unwanted ingredients.

3. **Start with a small amount**: If his healthcare team approves, begin by adding a small amount of protein powder (about 1-2 scoops or 10-20 grams of protein) to his Ensure drink. Monitor his tolerance and adjust the amount as needed.

4. **Be mindful of overall calorie and protein intake**: Ensure drinks already contain a balanced mix of protein, carbohydrates, and fat. Adding protein powder may alter the overall calorie and protein content. Aim to provide 1.2-1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, spread out over several meals.

Other ways to help your father meet his calorie needs:
1. **Offer small, frequent meals**: Instead of three large meals, try providing 4-6 smaller meals throughout the day. This can help manage nausea and vomiting.

2. **Choose calorie-dense foods**: When he can tolerate solid foods, opt for calorie-dense options like:
        * Nuts and seeds (e.g., almonds, cashews, pumpkin seeds)
        * Dried fruits (e.g., dates, apricots, prunes)
        * Avocados
        * Full-fat dairy products (e.g., whole milk, cheese)
        * Protein-rich foods (e.g., eggs, Greek yogurt, lean meats)

3. **Try other nutritional supplements**: If Ensure is not enough, his healthcare team may recommend other supplements like:
        * Boost or Carnation Instant Breakfast
        * Clear soups or electrolyte-rich beverages (e.g., coconut water, sports drinks)

4. **Encourage hydration**: Adequate hydration is crucial during chemotherapy. Encourage your father to drink plenty of water, clear broths, or electrolyte-rich beverages.

5. **Consider a feeding tube (if necessary)**: If your father is unable to consume enough calories and nutrients orally, his healthcare team may recommend a feeding tube to ensure he receives the necessary nutrition.

Remember to always consult with his healthcare team before making any changes to his diet or adding supplements. They can provide personalized guidance and help you develop a plan to support his nutritional needs during this challenging time."
274,My uncle has advanced stage cancer and is very weak. He no longer is able to swallow well and has lost weight and strength. What can we do to help him gain some of his strength and weight? I hate to see nothing else is being done by his doctor and home nurse. Will a GI tube be something to consider mentioning?,"Helping a loved one with cancer to manage symptoms and side effects can help caregivers to feel useful while also providing the patient with much-needed support. That said; I can hear how difficult it must be to witness your uncle facing such challenges, and to feel he is unsupported by his medical providers. 

First, I would definitely encourage you to address your concerns with your uncle’s oncologist. While it may feel uncomfortable to broach the conversation about your feelings about the lack of support, you have the right to ask questions and get information. It’s important that your uncle’s weight is a priority as this will likely impact his ability to maintain his strength, both physically and emotionally. 

Talking with a nutritionist or dietician on staff at his treatment center may also help you explore alternatives and to consider any foods he still may be able to tolerate and swallow on his own. However, tube feeding or intravenous nutrition can be a more practical way of helping him to get the nutrition he needs if he is unable to swallow on his own enough to get adequate nutrients. Feeding tubes and intravenous nutrition work with prescribed medications, so his oncologist and nurses may be able to educate him about the different options for tube feeding, as well as help him to get accustomed to this new way of feeding. 

You may also benefit from exploring these CancerCare fact sheets and podcasts which provide additional information on the importance of nutrition and dealing with weight changes:

It's heartbreaking to see a loved one suffer and feel helpless. 
 

**It's crucial to have open and honest conversations with your uncle's doctor and home nurse.** They have the full picture of his condition and can offer the most appropriate guidance. 
 

 Here's what you can do:
 1. * **Document your observations:** Keep track of your uncle's weight loss, swallowing difficulties, and any other concerning symptoms. Share this information with his medical team.


 2. * **Prepare specific questions:** Before appointments, write down your questions and concerns, including your thoughts about a GI tube. This will help you remember everything during the conversation.


 3. * **Advocate for your uncle:** Be his voice and ensure his wishes and concerns are heard by the medical team.


 4. * **Ask about palliative care:** Palliative care focuses on improving the quality of life for patients with serious illnesses. They can address pain management, symptom control, and emotional support.
 

 Remember, your uncle's medical team is your best resource. They can assess his individual needs and recommend the most appropriate course of action, which may or may not include a GI tube. 
 

 **Please reach out to them directly to discuss your concerns and explore all available options.**","I'm sorry to hear about your uncle's condition. Managing advanced cancer can be very challenging, especially when it comes to issues like difficulty swallowing and weight loss. Here are some steps and considerations that might help:
 

 1. **Consult with Healthcare Providers**: It's crucial to discuss your uncle's current health status and symptoms with his healthcare team. This includes his doctor, oncologist, and home nurse. They can assess his condition and suggest appropriate interventions.
 

 2. **Nutritional Support**: Since swallowing is a problem, nutritional support is essential. A dietitian can help in formulating high-calorie, nutrient-dense meals that are easier to swallow. Options might include smoothies, soups, and purees enriched with protein powders or other supplements.
 

 3. **Hydration**: Ensure he stays hydrated. If swallowing liquids is difficult, consider gel water or thickened beverages that might be easier for him to manage.
 

 4. **Gastrostomy Tube (G-tube)**: If oral intake is insufficient to meet nutritional needs, a G-tube might be considered. This tube is inserted directly into the stomach through the abdominal wall and can be used for feeding. It's important to discuss this option with his healthcare team, as they can evaluate whether he is a candidate for this procedure based on his overall health and prognosis.
 

 5. **Palliative Care Consultation**: If not already involved, consider asking for a referral to palliative care. Palliative care specialists focus on providing relief from the symptoms and stress of a serious illness. Their goal is to improve quality of life for both the patient and the family.
 

 6. **Medication Review**: Sometimes, medications can contribute to loss of appetite or difficulty swallowing. Reviewing all current medications with his healthcare provider might identify any potential contributors to his symptoms.
 

 7. **Emotional and Psychological Support**: Dealing with advanced cancer can be emotionally draining for both the patient and family members. Support from a counselor or therapist, possibly one who specializes in end-of-life issues, might be beneficial.
 

 8. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: Decisions about feeding tubes and other interventions should also consider the patient's wishes and quality of life. If your uncle is able to, involve him in the decision-making process. If not, hopefully, there are advanced directives or previous discussions that can guide these decisions.
 

 It's important to have open and honest discussions with the healthcare team about the goals of care and the potential benefits and burdens of various interventions like a G-tube. Each decision should ideally be made considering the overall benefit to your uncle's quality of life.","I understand your concern for your uncle's well-being, and it's natural to want to explore all possible options to help him regain his strength and weight.

Firstly, it's essential to discuss your concerns with his doctor and home nurse to understand their perspective and the current treatment plan. They may be able to provide valuable insights into his condition and the reasons behind their decisions.

Here are some suggestions to help your uncle gain strength and weight:

1. **Nutritional supplements**: Consider adding nutritional supplements to his diet, such as protein shakes or Ensure, which can provide essential nutrients and calories. However, it's crucial to consult with his doctor or a registered dietitian to determine the best supplements for his specific needs.


2. **Soft food diet**: Encourage your uncle to eat soft, easy-to-swallow foods like soups, yogurt, scrambled eggs, and mashed fruits and vegetables. This can help him consume more calories and nutrients without exerting too much effort.


3. **Frequent meals**: Instead of having three large meals, suggest having smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day. This can help manage fatigue and make eating less overwhelming.


4. **GI tube**: A GI tube, also known as a feeding tube, may be an option to consider, especially if your uncle is having difficulty swallowing or consuming enough calories. However, this decision should be made in consultation with his doctor, as it requires careful evaluation and consideration of the potential risks and benefits.


5. **Palliative care**: If your uncle's cancer is advanced, palliative care may be an option to explore. Palliative care focuses on improving the quality of life for patients with serious illnesses, and it may include nutritional support, pain management, and other comfort measures.

Remember to have an open and honest discussion with your uncle's healthcare team to determine the best course of action for his specific situation."
281," I'm a 71-year-old male just diagnosed with cancer and a heart transplant survivor. Four days ago, I had my first chemo treatment. Anticipating the usual side effects, I experienced none of those symptoms. Instead of tired and achy I almost feel invigorated. Am I just waiting for the other shoe to drop? Will the above symptoms manifest themselves in upcoming chemo treatments? What can I expect going forward?","Everyone reacts differently to chemotherapy treatments; it is not unusual to feel the way you did after your first treatment. As to what other side effects you may experience going forward, it is hard to say, as I mentioned everyone reacts differently. Based on the experience you had when you had a heart transplant, you may be using the same coping skills that you learned then to cope with your chemotherapy treatment now. Fear and anxiety are natural responses to scary and threatening situations, and everyone responds differently. Our bodies have what is called a flight or fight response, and when we perceive a threat to our personal wellbeing, our life, this mechanism is triggered, in which we choose to engage the threat or flee from it. To engage the threat means to understand the root cause for the perceived threat, and take steps to minimize its effects. Based on all that you have stated, i.e. feeling invigorated, sounds as though you are in fight mode. It does not sound like you are sitting around, as you said “waiting for the other shoe to drop.” If you begin to feel anxious about any side effects to your treatment, you can think of the coping skills you are already using that are working for you. In addition, you can also use breathing exercises and meditation to help alleviate your anxiety. Going forward, you may experience side effects such as nausea, vomiting, hair loss, chemobrain, fatigue, and some of these side effects can be well managed by your health care team with medication.

",Hard to summarize,"I understand your concerns and it's great that you're proactive about your health.

 1. **It's crucial to discuss your specific situation and any changes you experience with your oncology team.** 
 Here's why:
 * **Every patient is different:** How people react to chemotherapy varies greatly. Your age, overall health, specific cancer type, and chemotherapy regimen all play a role. Some people experience minimal side effects, while others have more pronounced reactions.
 * **Side effects can be delayed:** While some side effects appear immediately, others might take time to develop. It's possible you might experience some side effects from your first treatment later on, or they might appear after subsequent treatments.
 * **Your medical history is unique:** Being a heart transplant survivor means you have specific considerations that your doctors are managing carefully. 
 

 **What you should do:**
 2. * **Keep a journal:** Document how you're feeling each day, including any changes, no matter how small. This information will be valuable for your medical team.


 3. * **Communicate openly with your healthcare providers:** Don't hesitate to share any concerns or questions you have. They are your best resource for understanding your individual situation and what to expect.


 4. * **Focus on self-care:** Maintain a healthy diet, stay hydrated, get enough rest, and engage in light exercise as tolerated. These practices can help support your body during treatment.
 

 Remember, your medical team is there to support you throughout your treatment journey. Open communication is key to ensuring the best possible outcome.","It's understandable to have concerns and questions about how chemotherapy will affect you, especially with your complex medical history including a heart transplant. Each person's reaction to chemotherapy can vary widely. Some people experience significant side effects immediately, while others may have minimal or delayed side effects.
 

 Feeling invigorated rather than fatigued after your first chemotherapy session is unusual, but not impossible. This could be due to a variety of factors, including relief from anxiety, the effects of pre-medications such as steroids (often given to manage allergic reactions and reduce inflammation), or simply an individual variation in response to the treatment.
 

 ### Here are a few points to consider:
 1. **Delayed Onset of Side Effects:** It's possible that you might start to experience side effects after more treatments, as the effects of chemotherapy can accumulate over time.
 

 2. **Variable Side Effects:** Not everyone experiences every side effect, and the intensity can vary. Common side effects include fatigue, nausea, decreased blood counts, hair loss, and increased susceptibility to infections, but your experience may continue to differ.
 

 3. **Impact of Previous Health Issues:** Having a heart transplant and other pre-existing conditions can affect how your body handles the chemotherapy. It's crucial to be closely monitored by your healthcare team to manage any potential interactions or complications.
 

 4. **Medications and Supportive Care:** Ensure that you are receiving appropriate supportive care, including medications to help manage potential side effects. This might also be contributing to your current feeling of invigoration.
 

 5. **Psychological Factors:** Sometimes, psychological relief from starting treatment after anticipation and anxiety about chemotherapy can contribute to a temporary boost in your mood and energy levels.
 

 ### Going Forward:
 - **Monitor and Report:** Keep a close eye on how you're feeling and report all your symptoms or lack thereof to your oncology team. They can provide the best guidance tailored to your specific situation.
  
 - **Stay Prepared:** Even if you're feeling good now, prepare for possible side effects in future treatments. This can include arranging for help at home, preparing meals in advance, and discussing symptom management strategies with your doctor.
 

 - **Regular Assessments:** Given your history of a heart transplant, regular assessments of your heart function and overall health will be crucial during your chemotherapy treatment.
 

 - **Emotional and Psychological Support:** Consider speaking with a counselor or joining a support group. Dealing with cancer and its treatment is challenging, and additional support can be beneficial.
 

 It's great to hear that you're feeling well after your first treatment, and hopefully, this continues. However, staying informed and prepared will help you manage any changes that might come with future treatments. Always keep an open line of communication with your healthcare providers about any changes in your health.","I'm glad to hear that you're feeling invigorated after your first chemo treatment! While it's great that you're not experiencing the typical side effects, it's natural to wonder if this is just a temporary reprieve.

Every person's response to chemotherapy is unique, and it's difficult to predict with certainty how you'll react to future treatments. However, it's possible that your body may still be adjusting to the chemotherapy, and side effects may emerge in subsequent treatments.

That being said, there are a few factors that could contribute to your current lack of side effects. As a heart transplant survivor, you may have developed a higher tolerance to certain medications, which could influence your response to chemotherapy. Additionally, your overall health and physical condition may also play a role in how you react to treatment.

Here are some suggestions to keep in mind as you move forward with your treatment:

1. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water to help flush out toxins and reduce the risk of side effects like fatigue and nausea.


2. **Maintain a healthy diet**: Focus on nutrient-rich foods to support your overall health and energy levels. Consider consulting with a registered dietitian or nutritionist for personalized guidance.


3. **Get plenty of rest**: While you may be feeling invigorated now, it's essential to prioritize rest and allow your body to recover from treatment.


4. **Monitor your side effects**: Keep a journal or log to track any changes in your body, including new or worsening side effects. This will help your healthcare team adjust your treatment plan as needed."
300," When I was diagnosed, my cancer was aggressive and treatment needed to start as soon as possible. So when asked about fertility, I didn't get a chance to review all my options or come up with the money to get it done. I had a partial hysterectomy (my ovaries were removed but my uterus is still there). I was wondering what would be my options for children in the future?","When you are diagnosed with cancer you are faced with many immediate decisions to make, it is extremely overwhelming. It is challenging to process the news of your diagnosis, especially when you have been notified that treatment needs to begin right away.

** The best resource for you is a **fertility specialist (reproductive endocrinologist)**. They can assess your specific situation, medical history, and provide personalized guidance.
 

 1. However, I can offer some general information about potential options for people who have had a partial hysterectomy:
 * **Adoption:** This is a common and fulfilling path to parenthood for many individuals and couples.
 * **Surrogacy:** A surrogate can carry a pregnancy for you using your eggs (if you were able to preserve them) or donor eggs.
 * **Gestational Carrier with Embryo Donation:** This involves using both donated eggs and sperm to create an embryo that is then implanted in a gestational carrier.
 

 2. **Regarding your specific case:**
 * **Ovaries Removed:** Since your ovaries were removed, you would not be able to produce your own eggs. This means that if you choose surrogacy, you would need to use donor eggs.
 * **Uterus Intact:** The fact that your uterus is intact is a positive factor if you are considering surrogacy. It means a surrogate could potentially carry a pregnancy for you.
 

 3. **Financial Considerations:**
 Fertility treatments and surrogacy can be expensive. It's important to discuss the financial aspects with your fertility specialist and explore potential resources, such as grants, loans, or payment plans.
 

 4. **Emotional Support:**
 Dealing with the emotional impact of cancer and fertility challenges can be overwhelming. Don't hesitate to seek support from a therapist, support group, or loved ones.
 

 Remember, there is hope, and you have options. The first step is to schedule a consultation with a fertility specialist to discuss your individual circumstances and create a personalized plan.","I'm sorry to hear about your diagnosis and the challenges you've faced. Losing the ability to conceive naturally can be a difficult aspect of cancer treatment to come to terms with. However, there are still several options you might consider for having children in the future:
 

 1. **Surrogacy**: Since you mentioned that your uterus is still intact, surrogacy could be a viable option. This would involve another woman carrying a pregnancy for you. The embryo could be created using donor eggs and donor sperm or your partner's sperm if applicable. The embryo would then be implanted in the surrogate's uterus. It's important to consult with a fertility specialist to understand the viability of this option based on the health of your uterus and other individual factors.
 

 2. **Adoption**: Adopting a child is another pathway to parenthood. There are many children in need of loving homes, and this could be a fulfilling option if biological parenthood is not possible or preferred. Adoption processes vary widely depending on local laws and whether you are considering domestic or international adoption.
 

 3. **Foster Care**: Becoming a foster parent is another way to provide care and love to children who need a temporary home. While this doesn't always lead to adoption, it can sometimes become a permanent arrangement.
 

 4. **Egg Donation**: If you are interested in having a genetic connection to your child but cannot use your own eggs, using an egg donor is another option. The donor eggs can be fertilized with sperm (from your partner or a donor) and the resulting embryos can be implanted in a surrogate's uterus.
 

 5. **Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART)**: This includes all fertility treatments in which both eggs and sperm are handled. In your case, since you do not have ovaries, this would involve donor eggs and potentially donor sperm as mentioned above.
 

 It's important to discuss these options with a fertility specialist who can provide guidance based on the specifics of your medical history and current health. Additionally, consulting with a counselor or therapist who specializes in fertility issues can be beneficial. They can help you navigate the emotional and psychological impacts of your journey and explore your feelings about the different paths to parenthood.
 

 Each option has its own set of challenges, legal implications, and costs, so thorough research and professional guidance are crucial.","I'm so sorry to hear that you had to go through a challenging time with your cancer diagnosis and treatment. Losing your ovaries can be a significant blow, especially when it comes to fertility. However, there are still options available to you, and I'd like to outline them below:

1. **Options using your own eggs (not possible in your case, but I'll mention it for clarity):**
* Egg freezing (cryopreservation): This option is no longer available to you since your ovaries have been removed.

2. **Options using donor eggs or embryos:**
* Donor egg IVF: You can use eggs from a donor, which would be fertilized with your partner's sperm (or donor sperm). The resulting embryo would be transferred to your uterus.
* Donor embryo adoption: You can adopt an embryo that has already been created using donor eggs and sperm. This embryo would be transferred to your uterus.

3. **Options using a gestational carrier (surrogate):**
* You can use a gestational carrier, who would carry a pregnancy to term using a donor embryo or an embryo created using donor eggs and your partner's sperm.

4. **Options using your own uterus:**
* Uterus-only pregnancy: Since your uterus is still intact, you can carry a pregnancy to term using a donor embryo or an embryo created using donor eggs and your partner's sperm.

5. **Other considerations:**
* Adoption: You may also consider traditional adoption, where you would adopt a child born to another woman.
* Foster care: You could also explore foster care, where you would provide a temporary or permanent home for a child in need.

6. **Financial considerations:**
* Many fertility clinics and organizations offer financial assistance, grants, or discounts for cancer survivors. You may want to research these options to help make fertility treatments more affordable.
* Some insurance plans may cover fertility treatments, including donor egg IVF or gestational carrier services.

7. **Emotional support:**
* It's essential to acknowledge the emotional impact of cancer treatment on your fertility. You may want to consider seeking support from a therapist, support groups, or online forums to help you cope with these feelings.

I hope this information helps you understand your options for building a family in the future. Consult with a fertility specialist or a reproductive endocrinologist to discuss your individual situation and create a personalized plan."
316," I've thought about trying yoga (currently receiving radiation therapy), but am concerned I'm not strong enough or I'll somehow hurt myself. Are there special programs that are for people with an illness/cancer?","Yoga is a wonderful practice to consider while in treatment or post treatment for cancer. Yoga has been proven to reduce the psychological stress caused by one’s diagnosis while helping to manage the physical symptoms and side effects of treatment. Patients should always speak to their doctors to ensure that yoga is safe and right for them prior to practicing. It is important to be aware of any physical limitations that exist as a result of surgery or treatment. 

One of the great things about yoga is it can be easily adapted or modified based on the individual’s needs. It can also serve as the perfect segue to more intense workouts.

341," My brother is 70 and has been diagnosed with metastatic cancer. He has had chemotherapy and radium 223 treatments. Both have had harsh side effects (nausea, vomiting, weight loss, constipation, skin changes, weakness, sadness and depression). How do I as his caregiver support him? It's also not a good fit with his oncologist.","First, I would like to normalize your experience and how challenging navigating a loved one’s cancer diagnosis can be. Watching the physical changes that accompany cancer treatment can bring up many mixed emotions including feelings of helplessness. It can be hard to sit with the feeling of not being able to “do” anything to take his pain away. However, one thing that may be helpful is saying, “I am here for you. How can I help?” This can provide relief for him. Also, perhaps offering some practical ways to help. I am not sure if you live nearby, but perhaps saying, “I can walk your dog 1x a week” or “I will send you food on Mondays.” People frequently appreciate when we do something for them without asking what needs to be done. However, if you are not sure how you can help, it is ok, and encouraged, to say: “What could I do to help alleviate some of your stressors?”

Another helpful tip is using “I feel” statements. Sharing “I feel” statements can help in explaining what you are going through to your brother. You can share, “I feel I don’t know how to help you. Please tell me what I can do.” This can provide a good starting point for further conversations between you and your loved ones. 

Trust and rapport are very important when thinking about ones relationship with the treatment team. If you are feeling it is not a good fit, I would recommend discussing with your brother receiving a second opinion. One option is to look into the insurance company and see what other hospitals/physicians are in his network. Another thing you can do is to contact an academic medical institution or a National Cancer Institute-designated facility. 

Having a social worker or therapist to help you process everything can also be helpful. If you choose to look for additional support, feel free to look at the below link or call CancerCare’s Hopeline at 800-813-4673 and an oncology social worker can assist you further.

It's wonderful that you're there to support him. Caring for someone with metastatic cancer can be incredibly demanding, both physically and emotionally. Here's a breakdown of how you can help and navigate this difficult time:
 

 1. **Supporting Your Brother:**
 * **Open Communication:** The most important thing is to be a good listener. Let him express his fears, frustrations, and sadness without judgment. Ask open-ended questions like, ""How are you feeling today, really?"" or ""What's been the hardest part this week?""
 * **Practical Assistance:** Offer help with daily tasks like cooking, cleaning, transportation to appointments, or managing medications. Even small gestures can make a big difference.
 * **Symptom Management:**
  * **Nausea/Vomiting:** Work with his doctor to ensure he's on the right anti-nausea medication. Offer ginger ale, crackers, or other bland foods that might be easier to tolerate.
  * **Weight Loss:** Encourage him to eat small, frequent meals throughout the day, focusing on nutrient-rich options. Consult a registered dietitian for personalized advice.
  * **Constipation:** Ensure he's drinking plenty of fluids. His doctor might recommend stool softeners or laxatives.
  * **Skin Changes:** Keep his skin moisturized and protected from the sun. Ask his doctor about specific lotions or creams that might be helpful.
  * **Weakness:** Encourage gentle exercise as tolerated, even if it's just a short walk around the house.
  * **Sadness and Depression:** Be understanding and encourage him to talk about his feelings. Suggest a therapist or support group specializing in cancer patients. 
 * **Advocate for Him:** Attend doctor's appointments with him to take notes, ask questions, and ensure his voice is heard. If he's uncomfortable discussing certain topics, you can be his advocate.
 * **Respect His Wishes:** Ultimately, your brother's preferences and decisions should be respected. Don't force him to do anything he's not comfortable with.
 * **Encourage Social Connection:** Help him stay connected with friends and loved ones. Social interaction can be incredibly uplifting, even if it's just a phone call or video chat.
 * **Find Moments of Joy:** Try to incorporate activities he enjoys into his routine, even if it's just listening to his favorite music, watching a movie, or reading a book.
 

 2. **Addressing the Oncologist Situation:**
 * **Talk to Your Brother:** Gently discuss his concerns about the oncologist. Ask him what specifically isn't working for him.
 * **Consider a Second Opinion:** It's perfectly acceptable (and often encouraged) to seek a second opinion from another oncologist, especially if there are concerns about the doctor-patient relationship.
 * **Communicate with the Oncologist:** If your brother is open to it, try to facilitate a conversation between him and his oncologist to address the issues directly. Perhaps there are misunderstandings that can be cleared up.
 * **Involve the Care Team:** Oncology social workers or nurses can be valuable resources in navigating these challenges. They can offer support, guidance, and help facilitate communication.
 

 3. **Taking Care of Yourself:**
 * **Set Boundaries:** It's crucial to set healthy boundaries to avoid caregiver burnout. You can't pour from an empty cup.
 * **Seek Support:** Don't hesitate to reach out to your own support network—friends, family, therapist, or support groups. Caring for someone with cancer is emotionally taxing, and it's okay to ask for help.
 * **Practice Self-Care:** Make time for activities that bring you joy and help you recharge. This could be exercise, meditation, spending time in nature, or anything that helps you de-stress.
 

 Remember, you are not alone in this journey. There are resources available to support both you and your brother. Organizations like the American Cancer Society, CancerCare, and the National Cancer Institute offer a wealth of information, support groups, and financial assistance programs.","Caring for a loved one with metastatic cancer can be both emotionally and physically challenging.

32,My sister has stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer as well as tumors in her liver. Are there two different chemotherapy treatments for both the lung and the liver or are they treated with the same drugs?,"Stage 4 non-small lung cancer is characterized by the spread (also known as metastasis) of lung cancer cells through the bloodstream to organs outside the lungs such as the liver, brain, adrenal glands or bones. These cells attach to the new areas and begin to grow new tumors. The cells of the new tumor site, however, are lung cancer cells rather than liver cancer cells. So the chemotherapy your sister’s oncologist has chosen to treat the main tumor site in the lungs would also be considered the most appropriate treatment for the lung cancer tumors that have grown in her liver.

One of the benefits of chemotherapy used for Stage 4 lung cancer is not only that it’s treating tumors known to exist, but it is also working on other tumors that may be too small to be detected yet. That’s why chemotherapy is considered a systemic therapy - it treats cancer tumors throughout the body.

Find more information about treatments for lung cancer in our booklet, Treatment Update: Lung Cancer.

CancerCare also offers a full range of free support services for people affected by lung cancer.","Here is some advice:
1. Chemotherapy Targets Lung Cancer Cells: Stage 4 non-small lung cancer is characterized by the spread (also known as metastasis) of lung cancer cells through the bloodstream to organs outside the lungs such as the liver, brain, adrenal glands or bones.

That’s why chemotherapy is considered a systemic therapy - it treats cancer tumors throughout the body.",Seek an answer for a given question not advice,"I understand this is a very difficult time for you and your family, and I want to be supportive. 

 1. **It is crucial to understand that treatment for cancer is highly individualized and complex.** The specific chemotherapy regimen your sister receives will depend on a variety of factors, including:
 * **The specific type and location of her lung cancer**
 * **The size, number, and location of the liver tumors**
 * **Her overall health and medical history**
 * **Her genetic makeup (some cancers have specific genetic markers that can be targeted)**
 * **Her preferences and goals for treatment**
 

 2. **It is possible that the same chemotherapy drugs could be used to treat both the lung cancer and the liver tumors, as some chemotherapy drugs can target multiple types of cancer cells.** However, her oncologist might also recommend a combination of different chemotherapy drugs or other treatments, such as:
 * **Targeted therapy:** These drugs target specific molecules involved in cancer cell growth and spread.
 * **Immunotherapy:** These treatments help the body's immune system fight cancer cells.
 * **Radiation therapy:** This uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells.
 * **Surgery:** In some cases, surgery may be an option to remove tumors.
 

 3. **The best course of action is to speak directly with your sister's oncologist.** They can provide you with the most accurate and up-to-date information about her specific case and treatment options. 
 

 Remember, you are not alone in this. There are resources available to help you and your family navigate this challenging time.","I'm sorry to hear about your sister's diagnosis. In cases of stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) where the cancer has metastasized to other organs such as the liver, the treatment approach typically focuses on the primary cancer, which in your sister's case is lung cancer. The chemotherapy or other systemic treatments are generally aimed at controlling the primary lung cancer and, by extension, are expected to address the metastatic sites as well.
 

 The choice of chemotherapy drugs or other treatments like targeted therapy or immunotherapy depends on several factors, including:
 1. **The specific subtype of NSCLC**: For example, adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma.
 2. **Molecular and genetic markers**: Certain mutations or genetic expressions (like EGFR, ALK, ROS1, KRAS, etc.) can influence which targeted therapies might be effective.
 3. **Overall health and preferences of the patient**: This includes considering side effects and the patient’s ability to tolerate specific treatments.
 4. **Previous treatments and their outcomes**.
 

 In many cases, the same systemic therapy (which could be chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy) is used to treat both the primary tumor and the metastases. This is because the metastatic tumors are generally composed of cells that have spread from the primary tumor and thus share similar characteristics.
 

 For example, if a targeted therapy is appropriate due to the presence of a specific genetic mutation in the lung cancer cells, that same therapy is likely to be effective against liver tumors originating from the lung cancer.
 

 It's crucial for your sister to discuss her treatment options thoroughly with her oncologist, who can provide guidance based on the specifics of her cancer type, genetic markers, and overall health status. The oncologist can also explain the rationale behind choosing a particular treatment strategy and what can be expected from it.
 

 Supporting your sister in understanding her treatment options and their potential side effects can be very helpful. Additionally, consider discussing palliative care options with her healthcare team to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.","I'm so sorry to hear about your sister's diagnosis. In general, the treatment approach for stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with liver metastases (tumors that have spread to the liver) is to treat the cancer systemically, meaning that the goal is to control the cancer throughout the body, rather than treating each site separately.

In most cases, the same chemotherapy regimen is used to treat both the lung cancer and the liver metastases. This is because the cancer cells in the liver are likely to be the same type as those in the lung, and the chemotherapy drugs that are effective against the lung cancer are also likely to be effective against the liver metastases.

That being said, the specific chemotherapy regimen used may depend on several factors, including:
1. The subtype of NSCLC (e.g., adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, etc.)
2. The presence of specific genetic mutations (e.g., EGFR, ALK, etc.)
3. The patient's overall health and performance status
4. The presence of other metastatic sites (e.g., brain, bones, etc.)

Common chemotherapy regimens for stage 4 NSCLC with liver metastases may include:
1. Platinum-based doublets (e.g., carboplatin + paclitaxel, cisplatin + gemcitabine)
2. Non-platinum-based doublets (e.g., docetaxel + gemcitabine)
3. Targeted therapies (e.g., erlotinib, crizotinib) for patients with specific genetic mutations
4. Immunotherapies (e.g., pembrolizumab, nivolumab) for patients with high PD-L1 expression

In some cases, liver-directed therapies, such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), may be used in addition to systemic chemotherapy to control symptoms or reduce the size of liver tumors.

It's essential to note that every patient's situation is unique, and the best course of treatment will depend on your sister's individual circumstances. Her oncologist will work with her to develop a personalized treatment plan that takes into account her specific needs and goals.

I hope this information helps. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask."
33,My best friend's husband has just started chemo for lung cancer but refuses to quit smoking. This is driving a huge wedge between the two of them. Does smoking impact the effectiveness of the chemo?,"This is a common question that comes up for people diagnosed with and in treatment for lung cancer. Some lung cancer patients continue to use tobacco products either because the chemical addiction to nicotine is so strong that they are unable to quit, or they have found that smoking provides them with a soothing or calming effect in stressful situations.

A study featured at the 2006 Annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) reported that nicotine stopped chemotherapy drugs such as gemcitabine, cisplatin and taxol—all of which figure prominently in first-line treatment of lung cancer—from killing cancer cells and significantly reduced the effectiveness of the treatment, according to the researchers.

In contrast, another 2006 research study, conducted by the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, focused on the overall survival of late-stage, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who quit smoking or continued to smoke during treatment. The study, which followed the survival experiences of 1,370 NSCLC patients from 1993 through 2002, found no significant difference in overall survival between these two groups of patients. Among those patients who did survive, however, and who had quit smoking at the onset of their treatment, the risk of developing a second lung cancer was significantly lower.

You shared that your friend’s husband’s smoking is affecting their relationship. CancerCare’s oncology social workers often work with couples in situations like this and are able to help them develop new communications skills which can reduce stress and improve relationships. Please urge your friend to call us at 1-800-813-HOPE (4673).

It's natural to be concerned about your friend and her husband. 
 

 1. **You're right to be concerned about the impact of smoking on chemotherapy.** Here's why:
 * **Decreased Effectiveness:** Smoking can make chemotherapy less effective. This is because it can interfere with how the body absorbs, breaks down, and uses the chemotherapy drugs. 
 * **Increased Side Effects:** Smoking can worsen the side effects of chemotherapy, such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and mouth sores.
 * **Risk of Complications:** Smoking increases the risk of serious complications during and after chemotherapy, including infections, lung problems, and heart problems.
 * **Cancer Recurrence:** Continuing to smoke significantly increases the risk of the cancer returning and reduces the chances of survival.
 

 **It's important to remember that quitting smoking is one of the most important things your friend's husband can do to improve his chances of success with chemotherapy and his overall health.**
 

 2. **While you can't force him to quit, here are some ways you can support your friend and potentially encourage him:**
 * **Be there for your friend:** Listen to her, offer emotional support, and let her know you're there for her.
 * **Encourage open communication:** Gently suggest that your friend talk to her husband about her concerns in a loving and supportive way.
 * **Suggest professional help:** He might benefit from talking to a doctor or counselor about quitting smoking. There are also medications and support groups that can help.
 * **Focus on the positives:** Celebrate any steps he takes towards quitting, no matter how small.
 

 It's ultimately his decision, but providing information and support can make a difference.","Yes, smoking can indeed impact the effectiveness of chemotherapy. Here are several reasons why:
 

 1. **Reduced Efficacy of Treatment**: Some studies suggest that smoking can reduce the effectiveness of certain chemotherapy drugs. Chemicals in cigarette smoke can interact with the drugs, potentially making them less effective in targeting and killing cancer cells.
 

 2. **Increased Side Effects**: Smoking during chemotherapy can increase the likelihood and severity of side effects. For example, both smoking and chemotherapy can independently weaken the immune system; when combined, the effect can be more pronounced, leading to a higher risk of infections and other complications.
 

 3. **Lung and Heart Health**: Chemotherapy can be taxing on the body, particularly on the lungs and heart. Smoking exacerbates this stress, potentially leading to more severe health issues during treatment.
 

 4. **Overall Health and Recovery**: Smoking affects overall health and can slow down the body's ability to recover from treatments. It impairs wound healing, affects blood circulation, and reduces the effectiveness of the body's natural defenses.
 

 It's important for your friend's husband to discuss his smoking with his healthcare provider, who can offer guidance and resources for quitting. Quitting smoking is challenging, especially under the stress of a cancer diagnosis, but it is one of the most significant steps he can take to improve his treatment outcomes and overall health. Support from family, friends, and professionals can make a significant difference in his journey to quit smoking.","I'm so sorry to hear that your best friend's husband is going through this challenging time.

1. **Reduced treatment response**: Smoking can decrease the effectiveness of chemotherapy by reducing the body's ability to absorb and process the medications. Studies have shown that smokers with lung cancer tend to have a poorer response to chemotherapy compared to non-smokers.

2. **Increased toxicity**: Smoking can increase the toxicity of chemotherapy, leading to more severe side effects. This is because smoking damages the lungs and reduces their ability to clear out toxins, making it harder for the body to cope with the chemotherapy.

3. **Decreased oxygen delivery**: Smoking damages the lungs and reduces oxygen delivery to the body's tissues. This can impair the effectiveness of chemotherapy, as cancer cells are more resistant to treatment when they are in a low-oxygen environment.

4. **Increased risk of complications**: Smoking increases the risk of complications during chemotherapy, such as respiratory infections, pneumonia, and other lung problems.

5. **Worse prognosis**: Continuing to smoke during lung cancer treatment is associated with a poorer prognosis, including shorter survival times and a higher risk of recurrence.

It's essential for your friend's husband to understand that quitting smoking can significantly improve his treatment outcomes and overall health. However, quitting can be challenging, especially during a stressful time like this.

Encourage your friend's husband to talk to his doctor about quitting smoking. His healthcare team can provide guidance, support, and resources to help him quit, such as:
* Nicotine replacement therapy (gum, patches, lozenges)
* Prescription medications (e.g., bupropion, varenicline)
* Counseling and behavioral therapy
* Support groups

It's also essential for your friend to seek support during this challenging time. Encourage her to talk to her husband's healthcare team, a therapist, or a support group about her concerns and feelings.

The American Cancer Society (ACS) and the American Lung Association (ALA) offer resources and support for people with lung cancer and their loved ones. These organizations can provide valuable information, guidance, and emotional support during this difficult time."
36,I was diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer and am receiving chemotherapy. I've had two colds within a three-week period and also a low level of hemoglobin in my blood (the doctor has recommended erythropoietin treatments). Could these issues be diet related?,"Chemotherapy for either small cell or non-small cell lung cancer tends to be fairly aggressive and can produce some difficult side effects. While chemotherapy is focused on destroying lung cancer cells it can also interferes with the production of the three types of blood cells: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Normally, just before you start a chemotherapy session, your doctor arranges for you to have blood tests to determine the effect the chemotherapy is having on your blood cells. Low counts of any of these cells may prompt either a change in dosage or frequency of treatment, or a need to take medication that can stimulate bone marrow production of the blood cells.

Your colds may be due to the chemotherapy’s suppression of the bone marrow’s production of white blood cells, which are the body’s infection fighters. If your doctor feels that your white cell count has significantly decreased, he or she may consider putting you on a medication for this condition. Ask your doctor whether this might be a possibility.

Similarly, the low levels of hemoglobin you mention may be due to low red blood cell counts caused by chemotherapy. Red blood cells carry oxygen and iron to provide the body with components necessary for energy. Red blood cells are an important factor in maintaining energy levels in our bodies and too few of them can result in fatigue and anemia. It sounds like your doctor believes an erythropoietin-type drug might be helpful in boosting your red blood cell count. While extreme low red blood cell counts are not normally related to diet, you might also want to ask your doctor for a referral to a dietitian who works with cancer patients to develop a meal plan that would increase your dietary intake of iron and help you maintain a healthy weight.
